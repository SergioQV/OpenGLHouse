# Open GL House

This project was planned as a final job for a subject of the major of Computer Science in the Computer Engineering degree. The plan was to create a house in the middle of the forest, using a forest skybox to simulate that effect.

Some of the requisites were the capability of open doors, has a number of rooms or the complete size of the plot. It was also necessary to give the option of seeing the roof. That's why, between control keys, there is one prepared to rise the camera. In the sky, you can rotate the camera, but you're not allowed to move.
